# Artist Portfolio website <a href="https://isabelchan.netlify.app">Visit Here!</a>

Website that displays an artist's artwork.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white" alt="HTML logo"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white" alt="CSS logo"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E" alt="Javascript logo">

A responsive website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The focus was gorgeous content and an interesting, interactive menu and spotlight.

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I'd like to add in a functional purchase/payment back-end system.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how beautiful a one pager can be!
